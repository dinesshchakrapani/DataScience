    "\n",
    "Ans: Multithreading is a technique that allows the execution of multiple threads within a single process. \n",
    "A thread is a separate flow of execution within a process, and multithreading allows for concurrent execution of multiple \n",
    "threads, each performing a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used when you want to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as running multiple I/O-bound operations \n",
    "or performing calculations on different sets of data. It can improve the performance of your program by allowing you to take \n",
    "advantage of multiple CPU cores and reducing the amount of time that your program spends waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",
